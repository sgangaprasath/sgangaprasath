## S Ganga Prasath

Hi, I am an applied mathematician working on problems at the interface of mechanics, animal behaviour and robotics.

* I am currently learning
	* Neuromechanics of locomotion
	* Reinforcement learning
	
* I am looking to collaborate on multi-agent RL
* I recently wrote a set of tutorials on numerical continuation using `auto-07p` which you can find [here](https://sgangaprasath.github.io/elastInstab)

I am also interested in scientific outreach, right now on the climate crisis front. I am currently working with friends on a [website in Tamil](https://paruvanilai.wordpress.com) to create awareness about effects of human actions on the climate.
